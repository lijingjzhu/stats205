We want to first read in all of the demographic data. 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}


library(readr)


education_file <- "data/education.csv"
housing_file <- "data/housing.csv"
income_file <- "data/income.csv"

education <- read_csv(education_file)
housing <- read_csv(housing_file)
income <- read_csv(income_file)



```
